TESTS

Base Cases

-	Test all the combinations of gender, age, height, and weight to ensure every outcome comes out correctly; we test these 
  because the assignment specifically tells us to write a program having these outputs.
-	Test an empty donor name, incorrect gender names, negative age, height, and weight; we test these cases because the assignment 
  specifically tells us to catch these errors.
  
Test Boundaries

- Test donors 15, 16, 17, 21, 22, and 23 years old and 5’ tall of each gender above 110 pounds in order to test the age boundary
  inequality in your code to make sure you didn’t make a mistake.
- Test 25-year-old donors weighing 109, 110, and 111 pounds to test the weight boundary inequality in your code to make sure you 
  didn’t make a mistake.
-	For Women, test heights 4’9”, 4’10”, 4’11”, and 5’ with age between 16 and 22 years old and above 110 pounds to test the 
  height inequalities in your code to make sure you didn’t make a mistake.
-	For every gender besides Female, test donors between 16 and 22 years old above 110 pounds with heights 4’11”, 5’, and 5’1” 
  to test the height inequalities in your code to make sure you didn’t make a mistake.
  
Irregular Cases

- Input a double for an integer – example, 185.5 pounds for weight or 9.5 years, etc.; we must test this to make sure that if the
  user makes an error and enters 5.0 for age instead of 5, the program will still run and output that the user must input a 
  correct age. (***my program originally failed this test***)
