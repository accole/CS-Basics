Test Cases

a.	Test negative n values for every function because the spec sheet specifies a case for negative n values.
b.	Test the findMinimum() function to make sure it returns an index because those were the instructions.
c.	Test all the punctuation for the countAllPunctuation() function because the spec sheet says to.
d.	Test numbers with no leading number before the decimal, decimals with letters, strings with two decimals, 
     and strings with no decimals for the countFloatingPointValues() function because the function has to work 
     with all of those strings.
e.	Test multiple duplicates, including duplicates with indexes next to each other for the removeDuplicatedValues() 
     function because the indexes might not compile correctly.
f.	Test replaceAll() and check every index to ensure the function replaced all characters to double check the 
     indexes of the loops.
g.	For shiftRight(), test the function with a case where amount > n and where n > amount inputted.  Similarly, 
     test the function where n < the size of the actual array, and check the elements to make sure none are changed 
     after the first n terms, because it could have unforeseen undefined behavior in the program.
