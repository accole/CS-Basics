Project 5 Report

a)	One notable obstacle I had to overcome was understanding how to reference variables and methods constructed in header files 
    in the implementation.  For example, the method AppleProduct buyiPhone8(Kind kind, string version, string color, int gigabyte); 
    constructed in the header file would need the prefix references in front of buyiPhone8() and in front of Kind.  Creating a namespace
    and understand the scope for all the different #includes at different levels of hierarchy also was rather confusing.  I realized that 
    to create a namespace, and have a class be a part of a namespace, the construction of the class must be inside the declaration of a 
    namespace.  Furthermore, even if you include the header file in your implementation, you must still reference the namespace unless 
    you declare using namespace cs31 at the beginning of the .cpp file.

b)	Test Data:

    a.	Constructing an AppleProduct and an AppleStore with no parameters – because the default initialization of these must be specific.
    b.	Creating each AppleProduct possible using an AppleStore and making sure it compiles correctly – because multiple 
        AppleProducts are different
    c.	Running each of the member functions for every AppleProduct – because each AppleProduct has different private data
    d.	Try creating apple products with incorrect gigabyte values – because if AppleProducts are compiled with the wrong amount 
        of gigabytes a logic error should be thrown.
    e.	Run all the test data given in the main method Professor Stahl provides for us – because he gives us test data.
