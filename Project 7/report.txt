Project 7 report

1.  One of the notable obstacles I overcame while coding project 7 was understanding the use of ‘this’ in the NumberSet functions.  
    I understand now that when referencing the calling object, we must refer to it as a pointer through the word ‘this’.  Furthermore, 
    when coding an accessor function, you can use the ‘this’ pointer, but that is redundant and it can be easier said by simply 
    returning the private data directly.  Another obstacle I overcame was I had an error in the evaluate function in the board.cpp 
    when I tried to access the value of a specific cell in mCells.  When I called getValue(), I forgot the empty parenthesis at the 
    end, causing my code to not build correctly.


2.	Test Data:

    a.	Test the notFound() function by using <cassert> and testing inputs, because that was one of the functions we had to implement.
    b.	Test to see if the setImmutable() function is working correctly by using the isImmutable() function because those were 
        also parts of the program us cs31 students had to code.
    c.	Run tests on the evaluate function by playing the game and making sure the number outputted is the number of filled in 
        cells on the playing board
    d.	Test the program by trying to set values to letters or multiple numbers instead of just one number, because the coder 
        may not anticipate user error.  This outputted an infinite loop in my program!
    e.	Test trying to input values into rows and columns that do not exist, because these could be out – of – bounds errors.
    f.	Test setting a cell to a number larger than 9 or smaller than 1 to see if the game allows you to break the rules of the 
        game or crash your program.
    g.	Try setting a number over an immutable number, because immutable cells should not be able to be changed.
